Intro:
    Research Question
    Why is it relevant? examples (1. implicit, 2. explicit to make clear)

Methods: (~1 page)
    Baseline (Perceptron, NB)
    CNN description (formal explanation) convince that we understood
    RNN description (formal explanation)
    Embeddings


Experiments:
    setting:
        map experiments to Rquest
        Parameters:
            number of filters
            number of layers
            dropouts
            activations
            optimizer
            etc.
        Datasets:
            Size
            type of data
                mode
                source
    tweak 2 different hyperparams and run both datasets
    implicit emotion word recognition setup
    explicit emotion word recognition setup

Results:
    Quantitative analysis (Recall, Precision, F)
    Qualitative error analysis
